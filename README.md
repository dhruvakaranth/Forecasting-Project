# Stock price forecasting using Exponential Smoothing Averages

Exponential smoothing is a forecasting technique that assigns more weight to recent data while diminishing the influence of older observations. It uses a smoothing constant (𝛼
α) to control this weighting, with higher 
𝛼 values making forecasts more responsive to recent changes and lower values producing smoother results. This method is effective for capturing trends in time series data.
